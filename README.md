# Portfolio Page

## Index page

The index page is seprated into several sections and they are located in `_includes/sections`,the configuration is in `_data/landing.yml` and section's detail configuration is in `_data/*.yml`.

### `_data/*.yml`

These files are used to dynamically render pages, so you almost don't have to edit *html files* to change your own theme.

The following is mapping between *yml files* to *sections*.

* landing.yml ==> index.html
* index/language.yml ==> index.html
* index/careers.yml  ==>  _includes/sections/career.html
* index/skills.yml  ==>  _includes/sections/skills.html
* index/projects.yml  ==>  _includes/sections/projects.html
* index/links.yml  ==>  _includes/sections/links.html

This *yml file* is about blog page navbar

* blog.yml ==> _includes/header.html
